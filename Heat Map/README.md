Info about programs present in this folder. I hope these makes sense.. I am not so good with literature stuff.

backgroundCode.py
------------------

What this file does is it take 5 frames and calculates their median and generates a new frame out of those median values. This code will 
be used to update the background when their is no motion. Currently, We are taking first frame out and comparing next frames with the first
frame so as to detect the motion. And now what we do is after 1 loop finishes we update current frame to previous frame and 
again compare it so as to detect motion. But this is not ideal as even though if their is motion in current frame we are using the same 
frame with the next frame to find motion. So using this when we dont detect motion we will run this code and keep updating background
frame. Hope this increases accuracy.
