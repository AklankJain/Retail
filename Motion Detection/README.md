Run this script only on peopleCounter.avi video because we have to figure out a way to make video resolution dynamic. We are still working 
on it. For now, It runs on a resolution depending on the quality of video. (We have no control over it i.e. for now) Now this file simply 
counts the number of people going up and down and keeps them in a varible.

peopleCounter.py

Run this script only on TVS outside of store video feed. Again because for counting we are drawing two straight line on the screen and 
equation of this straight line would change depending on the video resolution. Except from that everything is same as pedestrian.py
